My own collection of Google Collab notebooks exploring and implementing core Machine Learning concepts.

This repository contains the Google Colab notebooks I created while learning and exploring various concepts in Machine Learning. Each notebook includes explanations, examples, and implementations to make the concepts easier to understand and apply.

📂 Contents

1  Data Handling & Exploration – CSV, JSON, SQL, APIs, Web Scraping, Descriptive Stats, Pandas Profiling

2  Preprocessing & Feature Engineering – Standardization, Normalization, Encoding, Pipelines, Transformers, Binning, Handling Dates & Missing Data, Outlier Detection

3  Dimensionality Reduction – PCA

4  Regression – Linear, Multiple, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Metrics

5  Optimization – Gradient Descent & its Variants

6  Classification – Logistic Regression & Evaluation Metrics

7  Ensemble Learning – Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Stacking & Blending

8  Clustering – K-Means

(More topics will be added as I continue learning.)

🚀 How to Use

Open any notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.

Run the cells step by step to follow along.

Modify the examples to experiment with your own datasets.
